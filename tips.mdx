## Task Management Tips

<Note>
  **The Two-Minute Rule**
  If a task takes **less than 2 minutes**, do it immediately! *(This keeps your task list from getting cluttered).*
</Note>

### Batching Similar Tasks
Group tasks by Subject, Energy level, or Location. 
*Example: "Do all Math tasks in one batch."*

### Using the Eisenhower Matrix
Prioritize effectively with this method:
- **Do First** - Urgent + Important
- **Schedule** - Not urgent + Important
- **Delegate** - Urgent + Not important
- **Eliminate** - Not urgent + Not important

### Subtask Power
Break big tasks into manageable subtasks:
1. Create main task
2. Add subtasks
3. Check off individually for satisfying progress

## Productivity Hacks

- **The Pomodoro Variation:** Try Ultra Focus (50m work / 10m break), Quick Sprint (15m work / 3m break), or Deep Dive (90m work / 20m break).
- **Energy-Based Scheduling:** Match tasks to your energy. High energy = New topics. Medium energy = Review. Low energy = Organization/planning.
- **The Seinfeld Strategy:** Don't break the chain! Use the streak feature and aim for consistency. Even 15 minutes counts.
- **Spaced Repetition:** Use SRS effectively. Review daily, don't skip reviews, rate honestly, and trust the system.
